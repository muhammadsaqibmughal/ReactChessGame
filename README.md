# ChessMaster: A Modern Chess Game with Single and Two-Player Modes
 

ChessMaster is an interactive, feature-rich chess game built with React, offering both single-player (vs. AI) and two-player modes. With a sleek UI, persistent game state using localStorage, and robust game logic powered by chess.js, this project delivers a seamless chess experience for casual players and enthusiasts alike. Whether you're challenging the computer at varying difficulty levels or competing against a friend, ChessMaster combines modern web technologies with classic gameplay.

**Persistent State: **Game progress is saved to localStorage, allowing you to resume exactly where you left off after a page refresh.<br>
**Pawn Promotion:** Seamlessly handle pawn promotions with an intuitive dialog for selecting pieces (queen, rook, bishop, knight).<br>
**Score Tracking:** Keep track of captured pieces with a scoring system based on piece values.<br>

**Error Handling:** Robust error handling ensures a stable experience even with unexpected inputs or edge cases.<br>
## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
**React:** Frontend framework for building a dynamic and responsive UI.<br>
**chess.js:** Chess logic library for move validation, board state management, and FEN (Forsyth-Edwards Notation) handling.<br>
**react-chessboard:** Component for rendering an interactive chessboard.<br>
**localStorage:** Persists game state (board position, scores, mode, etc.) across sessions.<br>
**JavaScript (ES6+):** Core programming language for game logic and state management.<br>
**CSS:** Custom styles for a polished and user-friendly interface.<br>
## üéÆ Getting Started
Prerequisites<br>
Node.js (v16 or higher)<br>
npm or yarn<br>

**Installation<br>**<br>

Clone the repository:<br>
bash<br>
`git clone https://github.com/muhammadsaqibmughal/reactchessgame.git`<br>

Navigate to the project directory:<br>
bash<br>
`cd chessmaster`<br>

Install dependencies:<br>
bash<br>
`npm install`

Start the development server:<br>
bash<br>
`npm start`<br>

## üß† How It Works
**Game State Management:** Uses React hooks (useState, useEffect) to manage the game state, including board position (fen), scores, and game mode.<br>
**Persistence:** Saves the entire game state to localStorage after every move, ensuring seamless resumption after a refresh.<br>
**AI Opponent:** Implements a computer player with configurable difficulty, leveraging chess.js for legal move generation and evaluation.<br>
**UI/UX:** Combines react-chessboard for the board and custom components for mode selection, game status, and popups.<br>
